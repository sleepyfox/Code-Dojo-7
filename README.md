Code Dojo 7
===========
This is my worked example from the 7th meeting of the London Code Dojo. Feel free to play around with them. You can run the code (assuming you have node and coffeescript installed) with:

    jasmine-node test-*

I set up a watchr file (demo.watchr) so that the tests are run automatically every time you save a file in your editor, simply run watchr (if you have it installed) with:
    
    watchr demo.watchr

The source of the kata is the Roman Numeral Kata that you can find [here](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRomanNumerals). You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
