Code Dojo 7
===========
This is my worked example from the 7th meeting of the London Code Dojo. Feel free to play around with it. Assuming you have Node.js installed you can install dependencies with:

	npm install

You can run the tests with:

    npm test

The source of the kata is the Roman Numeral Kata that you can find [here](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRomanNumerals). You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
